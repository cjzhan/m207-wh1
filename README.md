# m207-wh1
Short and scrappy Java program that computes Euler's and Heun's method approximations, created for a homework assignment for University of Washington's Math 207 (Introduction to Differential Equations). Beware of floating-point errors!

Usage: Pretty straightforward :) just change your parameters as necessary, and run the code. 
* `function()`, `function2()`, `trueValue()`, and `trueValue2()` are two differential equations and their solutions hard-coded in. If you want to use any other equations...write your own method.
* I repeat: **beware of floating-point errors!** Please! I'm just a first-year, I can't be bothered to fix the fact that my approximation happens to be two-trillionths off, sorry. If you're looking to send someone to space, or do brain surgery based on these approximations, please find a dev who actually knows what they're doing...and maybe an approximation method that's a little more accurate than Euler's (yikes!)
